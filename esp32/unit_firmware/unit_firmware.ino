/**
 * unit_firmware.ino - UWB Proximity Chat Unit Firmware
 * 
 * Arduino sketch entry point for ESP32 + DW3000 ranging unit.
 * 
 * This file serves as the Arduino IDE sketch entry point.
 * The actual implementation is in main.cpp and supporting files.
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - Edit config.h to set Wi-Fi credentials, hub IP, and unit ID
 * - See docs/CALIBRATION.md for ranging calibration
 * 
 * NOTE: Arduino IDE automatically compiles all .cpp files in the sketch folder,
 * so we don't need to include main.cpp here. The setup() and loop() functions
 * are defined in main.cpp and will be linked automatically.

// This file intentionally left minimal - see main.cpp for implementation
